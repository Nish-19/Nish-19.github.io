The goal of this blog is to present a tutorial on [Stable Baselines 3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/), a popular Reinforcement Learning library with focus on implementing a custom environment and a custom policy. We will first describe our problem statement, discuss the MDP (Markov Decision Process), discuss the algorithms - PPO, custom feature extractor PPO and custom policy (lstm bilinear policy with PPO).
