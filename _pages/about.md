Hello! I am a Computer Science MS-PhD Student at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst. My areas of interest include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and AI for Social Good. I work in the ML for Education Lab advised by [Prof. Andrew Lan](https://people.umass.edu/~andrewlan/?_gl=1*1o47w5j*_gcl_au*MjA1MzQ2NzgyLjE2OTc0ODMwMTU.*_ga*MTE5NjcxOTM3NS4xNjY0MjQ5NTAz*_ga_21RLS0L7EB*MTcwMjkzNzE0Ni4xNjEuMC4xNzAyOTM3MTQ2LjAuMC4w). As a graduate student I have interned at [AWS AI Labs](https://www.amazon.science/) in the Quicksight Q Team. 


I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the [Indian Institute of Technology](https://www.iitp.ac.in/) (IIT) Patna where I was advised by [Prof. Asif Ekbal](https://www.asifekbal.com/) in the [AI-NLP-ML Lab](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/) from my sophomore year. During my undergrad days, I also had wonderful oppurtunities interning/collaborating with several industrial ([SciSpace](https://typeset.io/), [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/), [Wipro Research](https://www.wipro.com/innovation/research/)) and academic labs ([IR group at UIC](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~cornelia/index.html), [DKE group at BUW](https://gipplab.org/), [VAL group at IISc Bangalore](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/)).
