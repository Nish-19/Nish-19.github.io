Hello! I am an incoming Computer Science MS-PhD Student at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst. My areas of interest include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and AI for Social Good. 


I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Patna where I was fortunate to work under [Prof. Asif Ekbal](https://www.asifekbal.com/) in the [AI-NLP-ML Lab](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/) from my sophomore year. During my undergrad days, I also had wonderful oppurtunities interning/collaborating with several industrial ([SciSpace](https://typeset.io/for-publishers/), [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/), [Wipro Research](https://www.wipro.com/innovation/research/), [Tildehat](https://in.linkedin.com/company/tildehat?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)) and academic labs ([IR group at UIC](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~cornelia/index.html), [DKE group at BUW](https://gipplab.org/), [VAL group at IISc Bangalore](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/)).
